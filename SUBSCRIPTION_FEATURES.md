# Subscription Content Features

## Premium Media Protection

KFans3 now includes content protection for premium media content. Here's how it works:

### Media Visibility Rules:

1. **For Subscribers:** 
   - Subscribers can view all media content from creators they are subscribed to

2. **For Non-Subscribers:**
   - Non-subscribers can view post text content but will see placeholder elements instead of actual media
   - Placeholders include visually appealing gradient backgrounds with premium content messaging

3. **For Content Creators:**
   - Creators can always view their own content (no subscription needed to view your own posts)

### Implementation Details:

- **Subscription Check:** The application checks if a user is subscribed to a post's creator before displaying media
- **Visual Indicators:** Premium content placeholders show different styling for images vs videos
- **User Experience:** Non-subscribers see informative messages about subscribing to view content

### Technical Implementation:

- Subscription status is checked client-side using React Query for efficient caching
- Server-side API endpoint to verify subscription status
- Custom UI components with gradient backgrounds for premium content placeholders
- Media components intelligently show either the actual content or placeholder based on subscription status
